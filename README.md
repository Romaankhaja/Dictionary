This Python script implements a speaking dictionary using speech recognition and text-to-speech capabilities. It allows users to verbally request the meaning of a word, interactively confirming their input through spoken prompts.
Features:
Speech Recognition: Utilizes the speech_recognition library to recognize spoken commands and words.
Text-to-Speech: Uses pyttsx3 to convert text responses into spoken audio feedback.
Dictionary Lookup: Integrates PyDictionary to fetch and display the meaning of words.
Interactive User Interface: Prompts users to confirm their spoken input for accurate word lookup.
Error Handling: Includes robust error handling for various speech recognition and dictionary lookup scenarios.
Usage:
Dependencies Installation:
Ensure Python and required libraries (pyttsx3, PyDictionary, speech_recognition) are installed.
Execution:
Run the script in a Python environment.
Speak "Hello" to initiate the speaking dictionary.
Follow prompts to speak the word you want to find and confirm your input with "yes" or "no".
Receive spoken feedback of the word's meaning if found in the dictionary.
